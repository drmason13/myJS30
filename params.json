  "body": "# myJS30\r\nInspired by Wes Bos' admirable javascript 30 series: https://javascript30.com/ (check it out);\r\nI try and keep up with the challenges whilst putting more or less of my own spin on things :)\r\n___\r\n## day1: [jsDrumKit](https://github.com/drmason13/myJS30/tree/master/jsDrumKit)\r\n### base project:\r\nusing even listeners and such, make the keys light up and make sounds when you press the right characters on your keyboard\r\n\r\n### the twist:\r\nSo me and probably everyone else doing javscript 30 got distracted playing the drums as soon as they were working...\r\n\r\nFirst thing I wanted to do? Lay down a looping beat!\r\n\r\nWell now you can!\r\n\r\nCharacters typed into the input will playback as if you pressed them on the keyboard yourself.\r\n\r\nCheck Loop first if you want it to loop.\r\n\r\nAdjust the slider to change the speed.\r\n\r\nAny characters that don't match a drum key take up time but don't play any sound. Use this to build rhythm!\r\n___\r\n## day2: [CSSclock](https://github.com/drmason13/myJS30/tree/master/CSSclock)\r\n### base project:\r\nusing transitions and transforms along with setInterval (again - that's where I got the idea for the drum loop in day1) make the hands on the clock go round\r\n\r\n### the twist:\r\nNot as impressive by any means. I simply adjusted the hands' length so you can tell which is which. This involved some offsetting.\r\n\r\nOverall, a nice looking clock. Maybe I'll think of more to do with this one later?\r\n___\r\n## day3: [CSSvariables](https://github.com/drmason13/myJS30/tree/master/CSSvariables)\r\n### base project:\r\nLearn and use CSS variables. New and Shiny and full of possibilities! If you thought Sass variables were neat, these are something else.\r\n\r\nMake stuff change size, colour and blurriness. Good use of sliders and more interesting events.\r\n\r\n### the twist:\r\nSo I started with a simple swap from blur slider to grayscale slider (looking at all these new-to-me css filters),\r\nthis introduced a whole new problem!\r\n\r\nThe colourful padding of the image changed to grayscale too.\r\nThis wasn't intended so I fixed it. Couple of divs and some trusty flexbox to the rescue...\r\noh and CSS [calc()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/calc), which is [var()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var)'s best friend!\r\nI've never used floats or negative margins and I certainly don't intend to start now!\r\n\r\n## day 4: [arraysForDays](https://github.com/drmason13/myJS30/tree/master/arraysForDays)\r\n### base project:\r\nLearn about four important array functions: filter(), map(), sort() & reduce()\r\nThis one was basically a textbook exercise and I did learn a few things and solidified my understanding of these important functions. Much less likely to fallback to a for loop without good reason now. reduce is particularly impressive!\r\n\r\n### the twist:\r\nI noticed there was a spare \"flavours\" array in the starter file, so I did a little something with that.\r\n\r\nUsing [array.reduce()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) I built a kind of \"menu\" object. It holds all the flavours in it.\r\n\r\nThe interesting part is that all the flavours had a lot of recurring words, for example: Black Raspberry Crunch, Raspberry, and Black Walnut. The menu object lists all these flavours under each \"sub-flavour\" built from their individual words.\r\n\r\nSo we get\r\n\r\nmenu.raspberry = [Black Raspberry Crunch, Raspberry]\r\n\r\nmenu.black= [Black Raspberry Crunch, Black Walnut]\r\n\r\nmenu.walnut= [Black Walnut]\r\n\r\nmenu.crunch= [Black Raspberry Crunch]\r\n\r\nI can see it being useful if you had to dynamically build some dropdown lists that let you filter some selection.\r\nI hope to come back to this and throw together a quick ice cream parlour online ordering with these flavours after learning some more tips and tricks. Ideally with people being able to design their own flavours and those getting thrown in :)\r\n\r\n## day 5: is tomorrow! see you then\r\n",
